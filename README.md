<h1> Recreation of the Prisoner's Dilemma problem in Java using different strategies and a Banker </h1>

Project inspired from [Veritasium's video on Prisoner's Dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&ab_channel=Veritasium)

Current strategies in the project:-
- **Always Cooperate**
- **Always Defect**
- **Tit For Tat** (Cooperates on first move and afterward repeats opponent's move)
- **Suspicious Tit For Tat** (Defects on first move and afterward repeats opponent's move)
- **Forgiving Tit For Tat** (Tit For Tat with extra 10% chance to Cooperate)
- **Vindictive Tit For Tat** (Tit For Tat with extra 10% chance to Defect)
- **Noisy Tit For Tat** (Tit For Tat with 10% chance to play opposite of choice)
- **Grim Trigger** (Cooperates initially but always Defects if opponent defects once)
- **Alternator** (Cooperates on first move and then alternates on each following move)
- **Appeaser** (Cooperates initially and alternates each time opponent defects)
